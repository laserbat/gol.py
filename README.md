# gol.py
###### efficient Game of Life in Python

This code demonstrates a small and reasonably efficient implementation of Conway's Game of Life in pure Python 3. The only dependency is a video player capable of displaying a stream of PBM images (e.g. [mpv](https://mpv.io/)).

Usage:

`./gol.py | mpv - --fps=60 --no-correct-pts`

You can change the output resolution by modifying the values of `W` and `H` in `gol.py`.

## How does it work?

Magic.
